## full-stack-app-resilient-roasters

This is a full stack web application for 'Resilient Roasters', a speciality coffee shop. The cashier can take the customer's order and send it to the baristas to fulfill. The baristas can create accounts and login to see which drink orders are pending. When they complete the order, they can put it in the completed queue.

### How It's Made:

This project uses EJS, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end and Node.js + Express.js, and MongoDB on the back-end. 


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use CRUD functions to operate on stored data in MongoDB. Also, I learned how to use EJS, a simple templating language that allow us to generate HTML markup with Javascript.
